# About Me

<img src="https://ZhuoLinLi-shu.github.io/lizhuolin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Zhuolin Li (李卓麟)**.

I am now pursuing the PhD at the Department of Computer Science, <u>Shanghai University</u>, working on **deep learning** and **multivariate time series prediction**, etc. Previously, I received the Bachelor's degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering of <u>Shanxi Agricultural University</u>, and a master's degree from the School of Information Engineering of <u>Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology</u>. I've published papers in top journals and also served as reviewers for several journals, e.g., Expert systems with applications， Advanced Engineering Informatics， Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, etc.

## Research Interests

- Multivariate time series prediction
- Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on Deep learning, graph neural networks, attention mechanisms and their applications (climate, traffic flow and power consumption forecasting, etc.).  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
